    <!-- Description -->
     <h1>Desciption</h1>

    <h2>Top Attractions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Anfield</strong>: One of the most famous stadiums in world football, Anfield has an aura and uniqueness that’s increasingly rare in the modern era of generic stadiums.

            Not every Reds supporter is lucky enough to go to games regularly, but taking it for granted if you are fortunate to make the trip would be a crying shame.
            
            Below you’ll find advice from Liverpool supporters, season ticket holders and journalists, on what to do when you visit Anfield – whether it’s your first time or 100th time.</li>
            <P><h4>Anfield</h4>

                <li><strong>Liverpool FC Museum</strong>: LFC stadium tour and museum has launched a brand-new tour- The Anfield Origins - which takes in the external surroundings of the stadium learning about the history of our great club as you are taken from the late 19th century to present day. Visitors will finish the tour on the illustrious Kop and take in the famous Anfield pitch.</li>

        <li><strong>Royal Albert Deck</strong>: The Royal Albert Dock[1] is a complex of dock buildings and warehouses in Liverpool, England. Designed by Jesse Hartley and Philip Hardwick, it was opened in 1846, and was the first structure in Britain to be built from cast iron, brick and stone, with no structural wood. As a result, it was the first non-combustible warehouse system in the world.[2] It was known simply as the Albert Dock until 2018, when it was granted a royal charter and had the honorific "Royal" added to its name.</li>

    <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
    <p>Come in peak season (April–August) for festivals, late-night walks and warm weather <br>
        Shoulder season (September–November) is perfect for a quieter visit and for enjoying museums and galleries <br>
        Visit in the off-peak season (December–March) for cozy coffee shops, boutique exploring, blustery walks and sunsets</p>

    <h2>Must-Try Foods</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="color: red;">Liverpool Tarts</li> 
        <p>Liverpool tart is a British treat. According to Google searches, the original recipe dates back to 1897. I was very keen to find out how this tart was going to turn out flavor-wise. Its taste is somewhat different from other lemon tarts which are usually almost overwhelmingly sweet.</p>

        <li style="color: orange;">Wet Nelly Wet nelly </li>
        <p>Alison spent her Saturday morning teaching us how to make Wet Nelly, a traditional Liverpool bread pudding. You see, when Alison is not volunteering at the local dog shelter</p>

        <li style="color: green;">Liverpool Bunloaf </li>
        <p>It might not sound the most appetising by its name, but the cake is actually modelled after a Nelson cake, a traditional Lancashire fruit cake.</p>
